## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- Use `fieldset` to group the radio buttons together
- How to style radio buttons with CSS
	- Use of `appearance: none` instead of `display: none` to hide the native radio buttons
- I was also able to reuse my learnings from the Intro Component with Signup Form challenge here, especially with using `aria-describedby` and `aria-live` properties for the error message and Thank-You display

### Continued development

Looking forward to challenges where forms also have custom styling

### Useful resources

- [Pure CSS Custom Styled Radio Buttons](https://moderncss.dev/pure-css-custom-styled-radio-buttons/) by Stephanie Eckles - This really helped explain how to style radio buttons using CSS without breaking accessibility
